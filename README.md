# Pelvi CRM

SOAP-first Flutter CRM for solo physiotherapists. Android-first, local-first SQLite, Hong Kong launch.

This repo currently contains the **first scaffolding slice**: design tokens, app shell (Today · Calendar · Clients · More + FAB), Drift DB skeleton, and a tiny first-run name screen. Full SOAP / calendar / CRUD come next.

## Requirements

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) stable (3.35+ recommended)
- Android SDK (for APK / device runs)

## Run

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs   # generates Drift code
flutter run
```

Android device / emulator:

```bash
flutter run -d android
```

Release APK:

```bash
flutter build apk
```

## Project layout
